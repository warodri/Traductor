# Traductor

If you're looking for just a few lines of codes to translate your HTML code, well, this is your place.

With this utility you don't have to use labels when you write a string, you just write your texts and then the translator will do the work.
It can also translate placeholders. For example: <input type="text" placeholder="This is a hint..." />
